## Run a Sample Using the Command Line Interface 
    
  1. Open the command line interface and navigate to the specified file [location](https://github.com/boldbi/iframe-dashboard-javascript-sample/tree/master) where the project is located.

  2. Run this command in the terminal to install the `http-server` package, which enables the sample to run a local HTTP server.

     ```bash
        npm install -g http-server
     ```
  3. Run this command in the terminal to initiate the HTTP server on a specific port(eg. `http-server -p 5555`)
   
     ```bash
        http-server -p <port number>
      ```
     > **NOTE:** Replace `<port number>` with the desired port number
     
 * Once the server is running, you can open your web browser and navigate to the `DashboardListing.html` file(eg. `http://localhost:5555/DashboardListing.html`).
